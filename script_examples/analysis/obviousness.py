# Obviousness
# Calculate an "obviousness" score using the policy net.

# "Obvious" and "common" moves are
# moves that are well-tested by KataGo over 
# zillions of games. If you missed an OBV
# or "com" idea, it's an opportunity to understand
# it fully, as it will show up in your games
# over and over again.

# this uses
# policy value * len(k.legal_moves)
# to stabilize scores across positions
