    Examples of things that are normally sufficient to anchor everyone:
    If all players have won and lost against other players, adding a make_center_elos_prior is sufficient.
    If all players have won and lost against other players, AND every player has transitively beat every other player and
    transitively lost to every other player, then adding a make_single_player_prior to one player is sufficient.
    Regardless of whether the players have won or lost, adding a make_single_player_prior to every player is sufficient.
    Regardless of whether the players have won or lost, adding both a make_sequential_prior and a make_center_elos_prior is sufficient.

    NOTE: Even aside from ensuring numeric stability and anchoring as above, it is probably good practice to add some mild prior
    beyond that anyways. If your players are sequential (e.g. a series of different nets), a weak make_sequential_prior could be good.
    If you want to just put all players on equal footing unbiasedly, adding a weak make_single_player_prior to each player that its Elo
    is 0 (or 1000, or whatever) is also good.

    And if you have actual prior beliefs about the players Elos, feel free to add those.

    Arguments:
    data: A single list of all the likelihoods from all your games and priors.
    tolerance: Stop soon after the Elos stop changing by more than this.
    max_iters: Bail out if the optimization takes more than this many iterations.
    verbose: Print out the iteration as it proceeds.

    Returns:
    Elos. Yay!
